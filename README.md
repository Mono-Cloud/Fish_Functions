#Fish Functions

----

A few functions I use within the shell fish. Stored on github so I can quickly use a git clone to have them availablke for use whenever I create a new Linux VM.

#cls.Fish

An alias for fish to clear the output of a shell

#fuck.Fish

Used to run the previously run command as root. So called because of what I say everytime I forget to run sudo before a command I need run as root

#full_update.Fish

Fully updates a system with the apt package manager.

#lsa.Fish

An alias for running `ls -a`

#lsal.Fish

An alias for running `ls -al`

#lsl.Fish

An alias for running `ls -l`
